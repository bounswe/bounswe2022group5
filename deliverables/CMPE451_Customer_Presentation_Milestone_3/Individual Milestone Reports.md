### **Main contributions:**

In the first weeks I helped revise and make some changes to requirements and scenario&mockups. I helped create branches and PR conventions for collobrative work. After splitting into teams, I created a roadmap for the Backend Team. After deciding on Django as a technology, I created the inital project. After that, I implemented the Authentication settings and documented and implemented the Login, Signup, Logout and Personal Info endpoints with the help of Token Authentication. I helped frontend and mobile connect to backend. Then I have started to implement Forum module with post CRUD operations. After that I have implemented CRUD operations of Articles. Of course there are always bugs in codebase and some of my issues are about this bug fixes. 
	
For final milestone I have implemente Text Annotation, Image Annotation and Semantic Search with ontology I have mentioned in the issue.

### **Unit tests:**

Since I was new to the language Flutter, I was not able to perform and create and unit test for our mobile application. I could only devote time to improving the features. Yet, I tried my best to test and improve every created feature by using our mobile application in emulator.

  

### **Additional information:**

Since it is the continuation of the CMPE 352 course we took last year, you can also find all the contributions I made in the previous semester on my [profile page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Engin-O%C4%9Fuzhan-%C5%9Eenol).
