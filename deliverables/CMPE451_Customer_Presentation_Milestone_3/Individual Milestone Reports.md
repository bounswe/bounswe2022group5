### **Unit tests:**

Since I was new to the language Flutter, I was not able to perform and create and unit test for our mobile application. I could only devote time to improving the features. Yet, I tried my best to test and improve every created feature by using our mobile application in emulator.

  

### **Additional information:**

Since it is the continuation of the CMPE 352 course we took last year, you can also find all the contributions I made in the previous semester on my [profile page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Engin-O%C4%9Fuzhan-%C5%9Eenol).
