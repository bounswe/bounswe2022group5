# CMPE 451 - Group 5 - Milestone 2 Report


## Executive Summary
### Summary of The Project Status

The project is in still alpha state. We are continuing adding new functionalities to it. Currently, the following functionalities are available in the project:
- Signup / Login / Logout
- Post create, read, update, delete, upvote, downvote operations in the _Forum_ section
- Comment create, read, delete, upvote, downvote operations in the _Forum_ section
- Article create, read, delete, upvote, downvote operations in the _Articles_ section

- Showing upvoted articles, posts, comments of a user
- Editing user profile

The project is maintained by a REST API developed by our backend team and presented as a web application by our frontend team and as a mobile Android application by our mobile team.

### Changes and Improvements Since Milestone 1
In the milestone 1, there were just signup, login and logout functionalities. Users were able to see their profile page with limited info and some static post and article data in the web and mobile applications of the project. Since then,
- Login and signup functionalities have been finalized.
- Post create, read, update, delete, upvote, downvote operations have been implemented in the _Forum_ section.
- Article create, read, delete, upvote, downvote operations have been implemented in the _Articles_ section.
- Adding images and location info to posts, comments, articles has been implemented.
- Showing upvoted articles, posts, comments of a user has been implemented.
- Editing user profile has been implemented.

### Planned Improvements for the Remainder of the Project
As we are coming to the end of the development of our project, we are planning to implement the following functionalities:
- Adding text and image annotations
- Semantic searching among posts/comments/articles 
- Following categories
- Interacting with a chatbot to navigate among our app

 * ### Progress according to requirements
 
	 #### Mobile Application:

	In the first milestone, we had completed the requirements for [Sign-up](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1111-sign-up), [Sign-in & Sign-out](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1112-sign-in--sign-out), and started to the implementation of [Profile Pages](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1113-profile-pages), [Article](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1123-articles) and [Forum](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1113-profile-pages) pages.

	In the second milestone, we increased the speed and countinue of the implementation what is missed on Milestone 1. 

	In the [Profile Pages](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1113-profile-pages), all the requirements are implemented and it is completed. Users can now see their full activity history on their profile page. Doctors can also share the hospital that they are worked in their profile.

	In the [Forum](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1113-profile-pages), most of the necessary requirements are implemented. All users can now see all the shared posts and scroll over them. They are also able to create and view, make upvote/downvote single post. They can add related tags and categories to their posts while creating. Also, commenting system for a post is also implemented to our application. Users can make upvote/downvote to a post. Users only cannot delete posts or comments that they are created.

	In the [Article](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1123-articles) requirements, most of the necessary requirements are implemented. All users can now see all the posts shared articles and scroll over them. They are also able to view, and make upvote/downvote single post. Only doctors can create articles. They can add related tags and categories to their articles while creating. Doctors cannot delete articles that they created.

	We also implemented some requirements of the [Setting](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements#1114-settings). Members can change their username, and the doctors can change their hospital name while editing personal information. Yet, users cannot change avatars/photos, passwords, or cannot delete their accounts.

	The other requirements in the [requirements page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements) are not implemented yet. We are eager to upgrade our application in the final milestone by adding them.

 * ### Annotations
    - We researched Annotations: what they are, standards, implementation, helping libraries to use with React.
    - We haven't implemented anything yet. 
    - We prepared mockups to show in the Demo Presentation. 
    - The plan is: Make a mode for users to use annotations. It will open a section on the right of the website. People will see their annotations, and doctors' annotations there.

 * ### Standards
    - We researched ontologies: what they are, examples, how to use them, how to implement them.
    - We added labels section in creating posts and articles. These labels are connected to the ontology [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html). We will improve it, it's only an initial design.

###  **Responsibilities:** 
- As a member of Frontend Team, my main responsibility was creating the pages that we will be use in the UI. One of them was the post creation page which will be used by the registered users, i.e. both doctors and members of the website, and the other one was the article creation page that will be used by only doctors. Addition to that, I have also made improvements on the Homepage and the Navigation bar that I have constructed before the Milestone 1, maintaining the landing page was my responsibility.

Created Article Creation and Post Creation pages on my own and edited HomePage and Navigation Bar with the newly added features on to the system. Adding logo, implementing button functionalities in the homepage are some of them. In order to improve the frontend, I have also do a lot of research about the components that we can use with React.
- Also, for the process of the project, I have taken a role of taking and collecting notes in the milestone presentation. Documented them on GitHub.
