## **Member:** [Sinan Kerem Gündüz](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Sinan-Kerem-Gündüz), Group 5.

###  **Responsibilities:** 
- As a member of Frontend Team, my main responsibility was building the components that we will be use in the UI. One of them was the navigation bar which will be common across all website, and the other one was the homepage layout that will be shared by posts and articles in the landing page of the website. Addition to that, I have also aligned the places that will be filled with Posts and Articles in the homepage.

- I have also take a part in the creation of the [Scenario 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Scenario-2-for-Milestone-1) for the mockups.

- Participating the customer meetings and team meetings was also one of my responsibilities.

- Together with Yavuz Samet Topçuoğlu, revising the previous [use case diagrams](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Use-Case-Diagram) and making appropriate changes.

- Updating the [team communication plan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Communication-Plan-Page) for this semester.

###  **Main contributions:** 
As a first contribution, we have build the structure of the frontend in the first meeting. Thanks to Burak Mert, it was a very clear and fast initialization of react.

After the initialization, together with the team we have designed the homepage, login, logout pages in the figma website.

I have implemented the navigation bar and connect the login/logout/signup buttons with links and functionalities. Since we do not have posts and articles in the website, the search bar has no functionality yet. Created the Navigation Bar as a component that can be used across all website.

Then, I have implemented the homepage layout as we have designed in the meeting. Also made some alignments for the Posts and Articles page in order to fit them in the homepage screen.

After all, Together with Alper Canberk Balcı, and Engin Oğuzhan Şenol, we have created [Scenario 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Scenario-2-for-Milestone-1) for the demo.

**Member:** Burak Mert, Group 5

**Responsibilities:** I am a member of frontend team for the project. Since I have some experience about frontend development, I was responsible for building initial structure of our frontend application. My main task was creating login and signup pages. To make these pages fully functional, I was also responsible for building API connection between backend. Dockerizing and deploying frontend project into an AWS instance were also my responsibilities.

**Main Contributions:** My first contribution was building initial structure of the application. During our first frontend meeting, I created a basic React application and create initial folders and files to decide on all tasks we need to finish in order to develop first version of the application. 

My main task was creating a login and signup page. I created two seperate pages with “/login” and “/signup” urls. For signup page, I created two different signup forms for members and doctors. For doctors, signup form has additional fields like document and branch of medicine. I implemented a flipping card to switch between two forms in the same page. I added several validations for form fields like password length and only-numeric password restrictions. I also created API connection between backend. I followed the API documentation on our wiki page, and used “axios” package to make requests. I also used “redux” to keep user information in application state. 

First versions of signup forms of frontend and mobile projects had different fields; therefore, I created an issue to align these fields for consistency.

After considerable amount of frontend tasks are completed, I created a Dockerfile inside the frontend proejct. I created an AWS instance and deployed our frontend project into the instance via Docker. After merging all frontend related branches into master branch, I deployed the master branch again.

- Preparing for Demo of Milestone 1.

### Main Contributions:
I am a member of the mobile team in this project. In the beginning, I had no prior knowledge about the mobile development, so I spent a considerable time for learning and practicing Flutter after we decided to use this framework. 

Then, after discussing with my teammates about possible structures for our app, I created the initial structure for it. I added initial screens, initial models, some mock data to use while developing our app, and decided the main theme of the app. 

Then I created the home page of this app. Home page is where you can access main elements of the app, such as forum, articles, chatbot, profile page etc. After creating this screen, I connected it with other available pages.

Then I created API service routines to use in mobile pages with my teammates. Then connected my home page to the API created by our backend team. I helped my teammates when they need assistance also.
	
After completing the mobile app for the Milestone 1, I created an APK and added its link to the [README.md](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/blob/master/app/mobile/bounswe5_mobile/README.md) file of the mobile project folder.

[Engin Oğuzhan Şenol](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Engin-Oğuzhan-Şenol)

### Responsibilities:
In order to develop the project, I have been in the many situations and tasks where I can put my effort on. Recently, most of the responsibilities that are assigned to me were relevant to mobile development. Since I have not done a mobile development prior to this project, I had to study Flutter and Dart to improve my skills for our application.

### Main Contributions:
For medical experience sharing platform, creating profile page of the mobile application was my most essential contribution. I was also the note taker of our development team. Also, I have been a part of Requirement Specification, and Creation of Scenarios and Mock ups.

#### Code related significant issues:
[(#207)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/issues/207) I created a Profile Widget and placed it above the profile screen. Then, I created a widget named buildName for showing the information of the active member. Lastly, I created a class named ProfileListItem, and created buttons for activity histories for Likes, Comments, Posts. Lastly, I placed the AppBar. that we used for many mobile screens.

#### Management related significant issues:
[(#217)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/issues/217) After [Meeting 16.1](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Meeting-16.1), we decided to revised the [project requirements](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements), and changed them according to Discussion. I reviewed all of the requirements that are according to our last decisions. I deleted the unnecessary ones, changed the altered ones, and added new requirements if there are absent ones.
	
[(#268)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/issues/217) After [Meeting 16.1](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Meeting-16.1), we decided to create two scenarios for CMPE451 Milestone 1. I was assigned for the [Scenario 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Scenario-2-for-Milestone-1). After creation of the first scenario, we created another character and created a different scenario for that character

### Pull Requests:
 - ([#228](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/pull/228)) As mentioned above, my mainly part was creating profile page for mobile application. 
 -  ([#273](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/pull/273)) To make the code look more organized, I separated files for profile widgets
 -  ([#276](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/pull/228)) After creation of the endpoints, I changed the mock data with the actual data.

### Additional Information
Here is my other important efforts before CMPE 451 Milestone 1.

## Group Review

### 1. Executive Summary

#### Introduction
We are a group of 12 computer engineering students from Boğaziçi University who are taking the course “Project Development in Software Engineering” in the 2022 fall term. We are creating a medical experience sharing platform for this course.

This is the first milestone of our project in this semester. It includes our progress so far, our future plans and the deliverables.

#### Description
Our platform provides its users an environment to share their medical experiences with each other, being informed about medical topics and also gives them the opportunity to receive responses from verified doctors. Anyone can use Android and the web versions of our application without being charged.

Anyone can register to our platform. There are two types of registered users; doctors and members.  Every registered user has their own profile pages. While registered users can benefit from all the features of our application, guest users can use some of them. 

There are three different parts that can be utilized in our application. First one is the Forum. In the forum, any registered user can share their medical experiences and get responses from other users including verified doctors. All users are able to view other discussion threads in the forum and make comments or upvote/downvote them. The second part is the Articles. Only doctors can publish an article in this part. All users can read an article on the platform and upvote/downvote it. The third part is the Chatbot. Register users are able to reach posts, articles and doctors related to the options they choose from the chatbot decision tree. Forum is the home page of our platform. The other parts can be reached through the buttons in the home page. There are also tags and a category can be added to discussion threads and articles.

#### URL of the Deployed Application

- [http://34.235.140.100:3000](http://34.235.140.100:3000)

#### Current Functionality of the Project

The Project is now at the alpha state, which states that it is not completed yet. Some of the features that are going to take place in the application are demonstrated with using some static and mock data.

At the moment, functionally, a user can log-in/log-out and sign-up to the website. After the login, he/she can see the a demo of the website HomePage and what it will look like when the project finish.

User also can see some static data in terms of posts and articles and switch the page between them.

For the mobile part, it is nearly the same as website frontend in terms of the functionality. There are also some static data in order to show and easily explain what will be the mobile app are going to look like.

#### Some Challenges We Met

Up to now, since we have worked individually on the academic projects, it was a very new thing for us to work as a 12 people group in a big project. Therefore, the communication and the division of labour was a challenge for us that needs to be resolved. At first, reading each others code or shared decision making was not quite east. But, we think that we have properly managed the process and successfully completed the tasks that we have committed to do.

Besides that, our knowledge about the technologies in the web development industry was a bit deficient. Therefore, before starting to implement, most of us needed to learn and practice a little bit to feel ready about coding and doing the tasks. First, we individually researched about the technologies, then decided on which of them we are going to use and made another research about the usage of the decided ones. Overall, our communication and labour division was adequate.

### 3. Evaluation of the status of deliverables

### 4. Evaluation of tools and processes we have used

#### Backend

- **Django & Rest Framework**: The fact that all of the backend team is experienced in python and they have done projects using Django before was effective in this choice. Especially Django, which has very nice built-in tools and configurations for rapid development, has been very effective for us in this regard. Thanks to the REST Framework that we were able to install on Django, we were able to successfully implement the RESTful APIs I wanted to create. We used Token Authentication for Authentication and we didn't encounter any difficulties other than overwriting Djaango's default User class. Django Rest Framework's serializer structures helped us a lot in converting database models to json. In short, we were able to successfully set up the authentication structure in a short time. In addition to these, Django has a very detailed official documentation, which has sped things up a lot. Even though Flask and FastAPI are more lightweight, it would bring a great burden to the team as we would build a lot of things when we wanted to scale them.
- **Postgresql**: Postgresql currently functions as the most advanced open source database management service. In this direction, using postgresql especially in python projects is a very preferred practice around the world. We wanted to benefit from the successful harmony of these two. Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language. Its core is a complete implementation of the Python DB API 2.0 specifications. Therefore, our choice as a team was in this direction. We have successfully created the tables on the remote server. Also, CRUD functions we created worked well with PostgreSQL.
- **DBeaver**: DBeaver is a SQL client and database management tool. It communicates with relational databases over JDBC drivers. For other databases, it uses proprietary database drivers. It helped us a lot in accessing the database and checking the changes we made. Especially in Django, it enabled us to fix the problems with direct access to the database that we had problems with migrations. As a fast and lightweight tool, it did not cause problems in installation and use.
- **VSCode**: Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and MacOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git checking, syntax highlighting, smart code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. As a team, we preferred VSCode, which can perform many different functions with its extensions. The biggest reason was naturally that we all had experience with this IDE. Being fast and seeing the changes we made while developing the API made a great contribution to the development process.
- **Amazon EC2**: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
- **Docker**: Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.
#### Frontend


#### Mobile

- **Flutter & Dart**: No one among us had experience in mobile development. Since we would have to learn something by scratch, we wanted to choose something that is worth to learn and also easy to learn. We chose Flutter because it is used for multi-platform app development and this is a trend lately. It is also pretty easy to learn after getting familiar with the concepts like widgets and asynchronous functions. However, we had to do lots of documentation readings because no one was familiar with these concepts. This learning process made our progress a bit slow unfortunately. However, we believe that our progress will be faster after this Milestone. Flutter made our lives easier when making API calls to the backend services with its "async" keyword. It would be much of a burden if we had chosen a different software development kit. Using Dart as the language was also not a problem, although none of us had written in Dart before, because the language is pretty similar to Java.
- **Android Studio**: We had a discussion with mobile team members about which IDE to use to develop our mobile application. Some members suggested using Visual Studio because most of us have experience using it as an IDE for many purposes. However, since we are developing a mobile application, we needed an emulator to run our app on for having not to connect a device every time we do a development. Android Studio comes with its own emulator. To develop a Flutter app with Visual Studio, we had to install a separate emulator. So, we decided to use Android Studio. It was a better choice because Android Studio is used only for mobile development purposes so it made our job easier. It was easy to develop an app seeing the changes on the screen of the mobile device instantaneously using hot reload. Using git is was also easy in Android Studio. Overall, we were satisfied with our decision.
