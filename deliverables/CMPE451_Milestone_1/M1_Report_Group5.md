### Main Contributions:
Since I was not very familiar with mobile development and I wanted to be a part of the mobile team, most of my time until the Milestone 1 was spent on learning. Firstly, I made a research about which language and tools that we could use and shared my knowledge with my teammates during our meetings. After deciding to use Flutter for mobile development, I practiced a lot to get familiar with. Then, my main responsibility was to create the sign-up screen and making its backend connection. I also helped other mobile team members when they had issues developing their own parts.

## Individual Contributions Report

**Member:** Burak Mert, Group 5

**Responsibilities:** I am a member of frontend team for the project. Since I have some experience about frontend development, I was responsible for building initial structure of our frontend application. My main task was creating login and signup pages. To make these pages fully functional, I was also responsible for building API connection between backend. Dockerizing and deploying frontend project into an AWS instance were also my responsibilities.

**Main Contributions:** My first contribution was building initial structure of the application. During our first frontend meeting, I created a basic React application and create initial folders and files to decide on all tasks we need to finish in order to develop first version of the application. 

My main task was creating a login and signup page. I created two seperate pages with “/login” and “/signup” urls. For signup page, I created two different signup forms for members and doctors. For doctors, signup form has additional fields like document and branch of medicine. I implemented a flipping card to switch between two forms in the same page. I added several validations for form fields like password length and only-numeric password restrictions. I also created API connection between backend. I followed the API documentation on our wiki page, and used “axios” package to make requests. I also used “redux” to keep user information in application state. 

First versions of signup forms of frontend and mobile projects had different fields; therefore, I created an issue to align these fields for consistency.

After considerable amount of frontend tasks are completed, I created a Dockerfile inside the frontend proejct. I created an AWS instance and deployed our frontend project into the instance via Docker. After merging all frontend related branches into master branch, I deployed the master branch again.
