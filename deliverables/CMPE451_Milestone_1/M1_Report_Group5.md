**Member:** Burak Mert, Group 5

**Responsibilities:** I am a member of frontend team for the project. Since I have some experience about frontend development, I was responsible for building initial structure of our frontend application. My main task was creating login and signup pages. To make these pages fully functional, I was also responsible for building API connection between backend. Dockerizing and deploying frontend project into an AWS instance were also my responsibilities.

**Main Contributions:** My first contribution was building initial structure of the application. During our first frontend meeting, I created a basic React application and create initial folders and files to decide on all tasks we need to finish in order to develop first version of the application. 

My main task was creating a login and signup page. I created two seperate pages with “/login” and “/signup” urls. For signup page, I created two different signup forms for members and doctors. For doctors, signup form has additional fields like document and branch of medicine. I implemented a flipping card to switch between two forms in the same page. I added several validations for form fields like password length and only-numeric password restrictions. I also created API connection between backend. I followed the API documentation on our wiki page, and used “axios” package to make requests. I also used “redux” to keep user information in application state. 

First versions of signup forms of frontend and mobile projects had different fields; therefore, I created an issue to align these fields for consistency.

After considerable amount of frontend tasks are completed, I created a Dockerfile inside the frontend proejct. I created an AWS instance and deployed our frontend project into the instance via Docker. After merging all frontend related branches into master branch, I deployed the master branch again.

[Engin Oğuzhan Şenol](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Engin-Oğuzhan-Şenol)

### Responsibilities:
In order to develop the project, I have been in the many situations and tasks where I can put my effort on. Recently, most of the responsibilities that are assigned to me were relevant to mobile development. Since I have not done a mobile development prior to this project, I had to study Flutter and Dart to improve my skills for our application.

### Main Contributions:
For medical experience sharing platform, creating profile page of the mobile application was my most essential contribution. I was also the note taker of our development team. Also, I have been a part of Requirement Specification, and Creation of Scenarios and Mock ups.

#### Code related significant issues:
[(#207)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/issues/207) I created a Profile Widget and placed it above the profile screen. Then, I created a widget named buildName for showing the information of the active member. Lastly, I created a class named ProfileListItem, and created buttons for activity histories for Likes, Comments, Posts. Lastly, I placed the AppBar. that we used for many mobile screens.

#### Management related significant issues:
[(#217)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/issues/217) After [Meeting 16.1](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Meeting-16.1), we decided to revised the [project requirements](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Requirements), and changed them according to Discussion. I reviewed all of the requirements that are according to our last decisions. I deleted the unnecessary ones, changed the altered ones, and added new requirements if there are absent ones.
	
[(#268)](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/issues/217) After [Meeting 16.1](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Meeting-16.1), we decided to create two scenarios for CMPE451 Milestone 1. I was assigned for the [Scenario 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Scenario-2-for-Milestone-1). After creation of the first scenario, we created another character and created a different scenario for that character

### Pull Requests:
 - ([#228](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/pull/228)) As mentioned above, my mainly part was creating profile page for mobile application. 
 -  ([#273](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/pull/273)) To make the code look more organized, I separated files for profile widgets
 -  ([#276](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/pull/228)) After creation of the endpoints, I changed the mock data with the actual data.

### Responsibilities:

- Attending the meetings.
- Updating our [wiki home page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/).
- Revising and updating the [class diagram](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Class-Diagram).
- Rearranging and preparing our repo for collobarative work among all teams.
- Building an initial structure (initial pages, models, theme of the app) for our mobile app.
- Creating and maintaining the home page of our mobile app.
- Creating the connections between mobile pages with my other teammates.
- Integrating the API services provided by our backend team into our mobile app, especially in the home page.

### Main Contributions:
I am a member of the mobile team in this project. In the beginning, I had no prior knowledge about the mobile development, so I spent a considerable time for learning and practicing Flutter after we decided to use this framework. 

Then, after discussing with my teammates about possible structures for our app, I created the initial structure for it. I added initial screens, initial models, some mock data to use while developing our app, and decided the main theme of the app. 

Then I created the home page of this app. Home page is where you can access main elements of the app, such as forum, articles, chatbot, profile page etc. After creating this screen, I connected it with other available pages.

Then I created API service routines to use in mobile pages with my teammates. Then connected my home page to the API created by our backend team. I helped my teammates when they need assistance also.

## **Member:** [Sinan Kerem Gündüz](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Sinan-Kerem-Gündüz), Group 5.

###  **Responsibilities:** 
- As a member of Frontend Team, my main responsibility was building the components that we will be use in the UI. One of them was the navigation bar which will be common across all website, and the other one was the homepage layout that will be shared by posts and articles in the landing page of the website. Addition to that, I have also aligned the places that will be filled with Posts and Articles in the homepage.

- I have also take a part in the creation of the [Scenario 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Scenario-2-for-Milestone-1) for the mockups.

- Participating the customer meetings and team meetings was also one of my responsibilities.

- Together with Yavuz Samet Topçuoğlu, revising the previous [use case diagrams](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Use-Case-Diagram) and making appropriate changes.

- Updating the [team communication plan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Communication-Plan-Page) for this semester.

###  **Main contributions:** 
As a first contribution, we have build the structure of the frontend in the first meeting. Thanks to Burak Mert, it was a very clear and fast initialization of react.

After the initialization, together with the team we have designed the homepage, login, logout pages in the figma website.

I have implemented the navigation bar and connect the login/logout/signup buttons with links and functionalities. Since we do not have posts and articles in the website, the search bar has no functionality yet. Created the Navigation Bar as a component that can be used across all website.

Then, I have implemented the homepage layout as we have designed in the meeting. Also made some alignments for the Posts and Articles page in order to fit them in the homepage screen.

After all, Together with Alper Canberk Balcı, and Engin Oğuzhan Şenol, we have created [Scenario 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Scenario-2-for-Milestone-1) for the demo.
