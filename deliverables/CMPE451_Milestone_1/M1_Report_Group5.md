### Main Contributions: 
In the first weeks I helped revise and make some changes to requirements and scenario&mockups. I helped create branches and PR conventions for collobrative work. After splitting into teams, I created a roadmap for the Backend Team. After deciding on Django as a technology, I created the inital project. After that, I implemented the Authentication settings and documented and implemented the Login, Signup, Logout and Personal Info endpoints with the help of Token Authentication. I helped frontend and mobile connect to backend.
