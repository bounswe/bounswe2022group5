## **Member:** [Mehmet Emre Akbulut](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group5/wiki/Mehmet-Emre-Akbulut), Group 5 - Backend.

### **Responsibilities:**

Prior to implementation responsibilities, I attended all meetings as a Group 5 team member. 
I expressed my ideas in the discussion topics, came up with new ideas and helped the team in determining the action items. 
Additionally, I was part of the backend team. Here, I fulfilled my responsibilities in the development, improvement and necessary bug fixes of Forum, Articles, Post, Comments and Profile pages, as well as the authentiocation implementation in the first milestone. 
I also played more of a role in Deploy processes in addition to previous milestones.
In addition to all these, I also helped my friends in the frontend and mobile teams, especially when they had problems with getting data from the backend.
